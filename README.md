A customizable clock

Want to get some more hours crammed into a day? This is the clock for you! 
Set how many hours there is in a day, minutes in a hour and seconds in a minute yourself.

See http://torkilv.github.io/customizableclock/customizableclock.html for example use and 
http://juliuslanghoff.no/index.html for a cool analog version (click the counter) of a 20 hour, 100 minute and 100 second clock!

Note: The clock is based on the time zone returned from the javascript date-object
